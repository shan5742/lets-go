# lets-go

This will be on ongoing repo documenting my learning of Golang, I have stolen this ide from a good freind and mentor, you can find his repo [here](https://github.com/Xercoy/Go_101). It is basically going to be a collection of problems solved in Go, these problems are the same as Jim Canning's C Programming problems, for those unfamiliar there will (eventually) be **101** problems.

All 101 problems can be found [here in .txt format](https://github.com/shan5742/lets-go/blob/master/101.txt) and [here in a more readable PDF](https://github.com/shan5742/lets-go/blob/master/101.pdf).

## Repo Structure

I will create a directory for each problem and everything for that problem will live inside said directory. Over time I will update the **README** with links and details of the problem completed.

### Problems

**Problem 1:** [Hello World](https://github.com/shan5742/lets-go/tree/master/01_HelloWorld)<br/>
**Problem 2:** [The Value 6](https://github.com/shan5742/lets-go/tree/master/02_Value6)<br/>
**Problem 3:** [The Character P](https://github.com/shan5742/lets-go/tree/master/03_CharacterP)<br/>
