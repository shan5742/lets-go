/*
***************** The fcsanf function *****************
Using your favourite editor, create file called testdata6 that has a single integer value stored into it. Write a program
that opens a file named testdata6, reads the single value stored in it using the fscanf function, and then prints the
value back onto the screen. You should call the function fclose before you return to the Unix operating system. Read
about the function fclose for a better understanding of it.
