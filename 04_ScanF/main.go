/*
***************** The Scan F function *****************
Write a program that reads in an integer value from the keyboard via the scanf function and then prints it back
onto the screen. You should know that scanf seeks an address expression. For example, &n is an address expression.
You should also know that scanf returns a value. It is either the number of successful conversions or an error code
that is typically EOF.
